## âœ¨ Overview  

LX-GUIAgent is an advanced GUI Agent developed by China Mobile's LingXi, featuring innovative Planner-Grounder-Reflector frameworks:


### ðŸŽ¯ Highlights
- Three-phase collaborative framework (**Planner + Grounder + Reflector**)
- Systematic task execution for complex workflows
- Modular design for flexible adaptation
- Independent optimization of components
- **75%** end-to-end success rate in [AndroidWorld](https://github.com/google-research/android_world)

## âœ¨ About LX-GUIAgent

**LX-GUIAgent** leverages a Planner-Grounder-Reflector architecture to address complex GUI automation scenarios. The agent features a clear separation of action planning, element grounding, and reflector modules. Operational rules, best practices, and domain-specific guidelines are systematically integrated into each module, significantly enhancing the agent's stability and accuracy.

The key innovations include:
1. **App Recognizer**: Automatically identifies target applications from user task descriptions.
2. **Operator Usage Guide Knowledge Base**: Provides tips and scenarios for using various operators, helping optimize their application in different contexts.
3. **App Usage Guide Knowledge Base**: Retrieves structured Usage_Notes (e.g. special operation paths, icon semantics, or domain-specific constraints) for the identified APP.
4. **Knowledge-Augmented Planner Prompting**: Dynamically integrates Usage_Notes into planning context for precise step-by-step reasoning.
5. **Reflector Module**: Refines and summarizes the execution results, providing clear feedback to users.
6. **Grounder Module**: Achieves precise target element localization by A11Tree structure analysis with action histories.
7. **Chinese-First Prompt Design**: All prompt content is written in Chinese to optimize performance for Chinese language models and ensure better understanding of task context.

These notes are injected into the Plannerâ€™s prompt context, enabling:

- âœ… Workflow Alignment: Ensures planning is closely matched to the specific processes of each application, minimizing unnecessary or repetitive actions.
- âœ… Robustness Enhancement: Addresses model limitations by leveraging external knowledge(eg. type with clear_text True to clear input field, prefer search other than scroll, prefer to open_app other than click app icon.).
- âœ… Rapid Adaptation: Enables fast deployment to new applications without the need for additional training.


## âœ¨ Technical Implementation

**Core code (lx_guiagent)**

- `lx_guiagent.py` - Core agent framework  
- `lx_guiagent_utils.py` - Core tools and utilities


**Evaluation Suite (androidworld_eval_result)**

- `androidworld_result.xlsx` - Task performance report
- `androidworld_level_result.txt` - Capability metrics

**Run Scripts (scripts)**

1. Download and install [AdroidWorld](https://github.com/google-research/android_world) environment.

2. copy agents/*.py to AndroidWorld `agents` directory

3. Edit _`get_agent` function in `run.py` of AndroidWrold to set your model and agent.

```python
elif _AGENT_NAME.value == 'LX_GUIAgent':
    base_llm = LXModelWrapper()
    rag_url = "http://ragurl"  # replace with your RAG service URL to retrieve app knowledge
    agent = LX_GUIAgent(env,planning_llm=base_llm, rag_url=rag_url,reflector_llm=base_llm, grounding_llm=base_llm)
```

4. `cd androidworld ` and Run `python run.py --agent LX_GUIAgent` to start evaluation.
